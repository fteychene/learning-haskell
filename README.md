Little project to learn Haskell in live on Twitch with @rlecomte as coach

## Concept
This project is worked on during live session on twitch in pair programming between myself as a Haskell noob and a coach (@rlecomte) to guide me to understand Haskell.  
This project does not intend do be used as a model for development or even should be considered as a good haskell code.
